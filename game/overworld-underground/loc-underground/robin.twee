					"난 강해져야 해." <<He_ nun>> 다른 무엇보다도 <<he_>> 자신에게 도움이 되기 위해 그렇게 말하는 듯하다.

				<br><br>

				당신은 당신 둘을 잇는 구멍에 손가락을 집어넣는다. 그게 구멍을 지날 수 있는 전부다. 당신은 즉시 손가락에 따뜻한 압박감을 느낀다.
				약간의 시간이 흐른 후, 당신은 손가락을 빼기 전 로빈이 부드럽게 당신의 손가락 끝에 키스하는 걸 느낀다.
				<br><br>

				"고마워... 네가 생각하는 것보다 그게 더 필요했어."
			<<case "dark">>
				"어둠 속에서 지내는 건 정말 익숙해지기 힘드네." 로빈이 건조하게 킥킥거린다. "난 물을 마시러 갈 때마다 매트리스에 걸려 넘어지고 있어."

					<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>

					"고마워." 로빈이 말한다. "만약 내가 여기 혼자 왔다면 어떻게 했을지 모르겠어."
				<</if>>

				"저-저기, 넌 어떻게 겨-견디고 있는 거야?" 당신은 로빈이 덜덜 떨면서 말하는 게 들린다.

					"너-너 괜찮아?" 당신이 묻는다.
				<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>

				<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>
					"망할 개자식들이 내게도 문신을 남겼어. 네 차례 바로 전에 그랬던 게 분명해." 당신은 당신의 피부에 새겨진 '163'이라는 숫자를 손으로 문지른다.

				<br><br>

				<<He_ nun>> 잠깐 침묵에 잠긴다. "이제는 돼지를 좋아하지 않게 된 것 같아." <<he_ ga>> 약해진 목소리로 말한다.

				<br><br>

				<<if $submissive gte 1150>>

					"이게 비디오 게임이기만 했어도," <<he_ ga>> 말한다. "우린 레이저 검과 날개달린 대포로 저들을 날려버릴 수 잇었을 거야. 네가 계속 날려대던 콤보도." 집을 다시 떠올리자, <<His_ yi>> 목소리가 조금 더 활기차진다.

					"난 너랑 하는 건 좋아." 당신이 대답한다. "그거랑은... 달라."
				<<elseif $submissive lte 850>>

			<<case "machineHigh">>

				You wait for <<him>> to elaborate, and <<he>> sniffles. "The machine hurt me. It was so fast, and so rough, and I can't even sit down now. So why? Why did you make them turn mine up?" Robin's voice becomes clouded with tears. "You knew it would hurt me, right? Why?"
