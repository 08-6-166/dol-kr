윈터 선생님이 미소짓는다. "잘 됐구나." <<he_ga>> 말한다. <<He_nun>> 항아리를 안전한 데에 내려놓고 뒤에 있는 방으로 들어간다.
<<he_nun>> 팽팽한 천조각들을 한 무더기 들고 다시 나타난다.
<br><br>

"이건 의상이다." <<He_nun>> 당신이 볼 수 있도록 옷을 잡아 준다. 여전히 천조각으로만 보인다. 어떻게 입어야 할 지나 이 옷이 과연 얼마나 몸을 가려줄 수 있을지 확신치 못하겠다. "생각보단 튼튼하단다. 옷을 갈아입고 있으면 내가 카메라를 가져오도록 하마. 우린 이 행사를 홍보해야 해. 네가 목마를 쳐다보는 사진이면 충분할 게다."
<br><br>

윈터 선생님이 한 번 더 모습을 감춘다. 당신은 옷을 벗고 천조각 하나를 허리에 둘러 감는다. 거의 치마처럼 느껴진다. 나머지 천들을 당신의 가슴에 둘러 감는다. <<breasts_rul>> 가리기엔 충분했다.
<br><br>

<<He_nun>> 카메라를 들고 나타나 미소를 짓는다. "완벽하구나. 겁먹은 표정을 지어 봐라." <<He_nun>> 사진을 한 장 찍고 멈칫한다. "혹시 목마에 앉아 줄 수 있겠니? 구속이나 그런 건 할 필요 없지만, 목마에 앉아 주면 더 나을 것 같구나."
<br><br>

당신은 목마 위로 기어올라 편하게 자세를 낮춘다. 단단한 나무가 당신의 <<print ($player.ballsExist ? "불알을" : "음순을")>> 누른다.
당신은 보호하려고 당신의 짧고 팽팽한 치마를 다리 사이로 밀어 보지만, 전혀 도움이 되지 않는다. 완전히 불편하지 않은 상태로는 앉을 수 없는 것 같다.
<br><br>

윈터 선생님은 마지막 사진을 찍는다. <<He_nun>> 만족한 것으로 보인다. "고맙구나. 분명 효과가 있을 거야." <<He_nun>> 당신이 옷을 갈아입을 수 있게 방에서 나간다.

Winter leads you outside, down the small side road, and into the park. You hear voices up ahead as you approach the river.
Winter stops you beside the toilets, and pushes a bundle of rags into your hands. "We don't want to get your clothes wet. I'll look after them until you're done."
<br><br>

You enter the toilets and change into the rags. They're tight and revealing. You wonder how you look. You'll soon have an audience.

You step outside and hand your clothes to Winter. "Very good," <<he>> says. "One more thing. I don't want you to feel any pressure to accept, but I have a suggestion."

	"The demonstration will be more authentic if I submerge you completely," Winter says, producing a small device dominated by a green button.
	"I'll give you this waterproof buzzer, which will notify me the instant you want the demonstration to stop." <<He>> presses the button, and <<his>> pocket vibrates.
	"You'll be underwater, and this will be your only way to communicate with me."
	<br><br>

	"Again, I must stress that you should feel no pressure to accept," <<he>> adds. "It would help sell the scene and drum up interest, but I know I'm asking a lot."

Winter nods, and hands you the green buzzer. <<He>> stands on <<his>> toes to peer above a hedge. "Everyone's ready," <<he>> says. "We've got a crowd waiting. Come."
<br><br>
You follow Winter around the hedge. There's a large crowd, maybe a hundred people, stood around the ducking stool. They look at Winter, and at you, eager to begin.
<br><br>

"Ladies and gentlemen," Winter begins, gesturing for you to take a seat. "Today we are here to witness the punishment of this rapscallion."
<<He>> pulls the straps over you, and binds you down tight. "A con artist, who swindled many good citizens. Now <<pshe>> faces justice."
<br><br>

Winter walks to the other end of the crane, and lifts you into the air.
<<He>> continues to talk about the ducking stool as <<he>> pushes you over the river. The water rushes beneath you.

Winter pulls a lever, and you descend toward the water below. It splashes against your feet, then your legs, then up to your abdomen and chest.
It's cold. You wonder how long the demonstration will last.
<br><br>

"Such a punishment was not usually fatal," Winter says, pulling the lever in the other direction. You begin to rise. "Public humiliation was the primary goal."
The audience murmur amongst themselves. With a flash of panic, you look down to make sure the rags have not soaked to transparency.
Before you can get a good look, Winter plunges you into the river once more, this time up to your neck.
<br><br>

With a final push of the lever, the chair lowers the rest of the way, submerging you.

Winter nods, and stands on <<his>> toes to peer above a hedge. "Everyone's ready," <<he>> says. "We've got a crowd waiting. Come."
<br><br>
You follow Winter around the hedge. There's a large crowd, maybe a hundred people, stood around the ducking stool. They look at Winter, and at you, eager to begin.
<br><br>

"Ladies and gentlemen," Winter begins, gesturing for you to take a seat. "Today we are here to witness the punishment of this rapscallion."
<<He>> pulls the straps over you, and binds you down tight. "A con artist, who swindled many good citizens. Now <<pshe>> faces justice."
<br><br>

Winter walks to the other end of the crane, and lifts you into the air. <<He>> continues to talk about the ducking stool as <<he>> pushes you over the river.
The water rushes beneath you.
<br><br>

Winter pulls a lever, and you descend toward the water below. It splashes against your feet, then your legs, then up to your abdomen and chest. It's cold.
You wonder how long the demonstration will last.
<br><br>

"Such a punishment was not usually fatal," Winter says, pulling the lever in the other direction. You begin to rise. "Public humiliation was the primary goal."
The audience murmur amongst themselves. With a flash of panic, you look down to make sure the rags have not soaked to transparency.
Before you can get a good look, Winter plunges you into the river once more, this time up to your neck.
<br><br>

You point your face up to avoid the water, but Winter doesn't keep you there long.
You look down at your body as the chair rises, and are relieved to find that the rags are not transparent.
They do cling though, giving a hint of what lies beneath. Enough to make you uncomfortable.

Winter pulls the crane back round, until you hover above the earth. <<He>> lowers you to the ground, then rushes over to steady the chair and unbind you.
<br><br>

"That ends our demonstration. Thank you for attending. We hope you found it informative, and we invite you to visit the museum.
The address is on the booklets we handed out. It's right over there." <<He>> points. "Last but not least, let's have a round of applause for our star."
<<He>> gestures at you. The audience applaud politely, their eyes exploring your wet body.
<br><br>

Winter wraps a heated towel around you, and then a second, for the journey back to the museum. "You did well," <<he>> says on the way back.
"I'm blessed to have your assistance. Thank you. I'd like to repeat the demonstration next weekend if it suits you."
<<He>> glances back. Much of the audience is following. "I think we've earned some new interest."

You arrive at the museum. <<He>> takes you to a small side room, and leaves you to get dressed.

	"There are degrees of authenticity. If it's okay with you, I'd like to weigh you down as they would have in the past. And whip you. Not too hard, but enough to impress."

Winter nods. <<He>> peeks around the door. "Everyone's in. It's time. Wait for your cue." <<He>> returns to the museum proper.
<br><br>

"Ladies and gentlemen," Winter begins. <<He>> stands on a raised platform beside the horse, addressing an audience of around fifty people.
"Our town has a rich history. Of great deeds and heroism yes, but also of tragedy and brutality. Take this <<girl>>,"
<<He>> gestures at the door, and you <<nervously>> emerge into the museum. A <<person2>><<person>> stands closest to you. <<He>> licks <<his>> lips.
<br><br>

<<person1>>"Caught stealing bread for <<pher>> starving sibling," Winter continues. "<<pShe>> must now face the lord's justice."
You climb atop the horse and ease yourself down. You feel it press into your crotch like before.
<<masopain 5>><<arousal 1200>>
<br><br>

Winter continues <<his>> speech, talking about the specifics of the horse. And how it was used. <<He>> steps behind you while doing so, and begins to tie your arms.
<<He>> works fast, and before long your arms are bound and immobile.
<br><br>

The audience is enraptured by the spectacle. You feel their eyes on your barely-covered <<genitals>>. "Of course, humiliation was part of the punishment."
<<He>> throws open a chest at <<his>> feet, and reaches in. <<He>> pulls out a metal weight. You see straps dangling from it before <<he>> kneels beside you.
<<He>> ties one to your ankle, and gently releases it. It was uncomfortable before, but now it hurts.
<<He>> walks around the horse and repeats the process. Your eyes water.

You scream as the whip lashes against your skin. Again and again. The audience gapes at the spectacle.

윈터 선생님은 멈추지 않는다. <<he_nun>> 계속, 계속해서 당신의 살을 후려친다. 일부 관중들은 불안해하고, 나머지는 충격을 받은 것 같다. 개중에는 이걸 명백히 즐기고 있는 사람들도 있다.
<br><br>

당신이 기절할 것 같다고 느껴질 때 쯤, 윈터 선생님이 채찍질을 멈춘다. <<He_nun>> 헉헉거리며 당신 앞으로 걸어나온다. "시연은 여기까지입니다." <<he_ga>> 말한다.
